# Statistics
For Math 332 Statistics, we used R-Markdown to create various statistical reports on water data. I used R-Markdown to show important parts of the code and to display images in an orderly fashion. Overall this was a very informative class on statistical methods on real world data and allowed me to show how much I had learned in the course.
